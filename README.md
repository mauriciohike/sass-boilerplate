Boilerplate created to facilitate the initial structure of sass projects.

## 🔧 Usage
I created the compile script with **node-sass**, need to run this command:

    npm install

Then:

    npm run build:scss


The compiled file will be in **css** folder.

## 📂 Folder Structure
Inspirated in **7-1 Pattern** (just excluding the **vendor** folder), this is the folder structure: 

    scss/
    |
    |– utilities/
    |
    |– base/
    |
    |– components/
    |
    |– layout/
    |
    |– pages/
    |
    |– themes/
    |
    `– main.scss
